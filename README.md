# Roulette

this is a basic python program for the popular game; Roulette. this was made as a part of my learning journey into python.

How to play:
1. after running the program the user must enter the number he wants to bet on and the amount he's betting, every time the program is run the balance available to user is 100000 units
2. bet on atleast Three numbers with different amounts for better understanding

packages used:
1. random
2. pandas

   
how to program works: 
since we as a casino would want maximum profit, and in order to maximize profit we would want that a number comes on which the bet is lowest, if not 0.
we however also do not want that nobody wins and every player loses, so we make the person with lowest bet win the round, so there's an illusion that somebody won.
if there are two equal bets made which are the lowest, made on two different numbers then the winning number is selected at random.
enjoy!!
